### A Little About Me

Hello there. I'm Ey Rhen. I'm a dude that likes to do a lot of different things. I'm a programmer, a writer, and everything in between. I've started learning to code 7 years ago as a means to have a career as a disabled person. I gotta say that I've gotten pretty good at it.

### Goal Of This Profile

I made this profile so that I will have something to provide if an employer, for example ask for a portfolio. I made various portfolios over the years but none of them really work so I hope this one would.
